Last night, my mother told me that we would have a picnic with my uncleâ€™s families in a park.
I was so excited.
The elders sat at the ground and talked about the work stuffs and family issues, 
while the children were playing around. My cousins and I went to the fairground.
We took the pirate boat, which made us scream out loudly.
I will never forget the feeling of taking the pirate boat.
Besides, we also played other interesting activities. 
For me, it was a happy day. 
For my parents, I thought they were happy, too.
